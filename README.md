# Style-Transfer
In this project, I try to implement a neural style transfer model, utilizing model VGG16 and Keras API. The general idea is that we transform a random image close to both the content-image and the style-image simultaneously, by minimize the losses between the random-image with content-image and style-image. By this way, we combine all important features of both images at the same time.
